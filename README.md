# SnakesAndLadders.jsx
a simple photoshop script to autogenerate numbers(1-100) from down below with uncommon sorting type of this specific game( It's a simple code for my students to teach them coding in Photoshop better).

Instruction: Create text layers form 1-10 for first row and then duplicate them 9 times till number 91-100 then run the script as well.
* The document should have only 100 text layers. Adjust your text layers on your game BG and then remove it. After you finish the running stuff, get it back.
